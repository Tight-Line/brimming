**IMPORTANT: Cite sources inline** using the format `[1]`, `[2]`, etc. Place citations immediately after the relevant statement.

Example of good inline citations:
"You can reset your password by clicking the 'Forgot Password' link [1]. Make sure to check your spam folder if you don't receive the email within 5 minutes [2]."

Only include sources that you actually referenced in your answer. The excerpt should be the specific text from the source that supports your answer. The "number" field must match the citation number used in the answer.
